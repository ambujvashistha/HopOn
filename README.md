## 3. 📌 Problem Statement
In many hostels, students rely on WhatsApp groups to share bus arrival updates, but most have these groups muted due to spam or irrelevant messages.  
This often leads to missed buses or last-minute rush. There is no simple, dedicated platform for quick and reliable bus arrival alerts.

---

## 4. ✅ Proposed Solution
A mobile application that allows hostel students to send and receive instant bus arrival alerts with just one tap.  
The system will:
- Use push notifications to ensure alerts are seen immediately.
- Limit spam by controlling alert frequency.
- Allow quick WhatsApp broadcast messages to all registered users when needed.

---

## 5. 🔑 Key Features
- **One-Tap Bus Alert** – Instantly notify all hostel members when the bus is arriving.
- **Push Notifications (FCM)** – Deliver alerts even if the app is closed.
- **Smart Alert Timing** – Prevent spam by restricting repeated alerts in a short time window.
- **User Authentication** – Secure login via email & phone number.
- **Different Alert Sounds** – Let users customize how they hear bus arrival notifications.
